# Client situation 

- Excellent business development 
- Great engineer team 
- Design is outsourced (only PSDs) デザインは外注 （PSD だけ...）
- Don't need coders

→ Great engineers have their time taken up doing HTML/CSS (and it doesn't raise the quality)  

---


# Issues with working with a client

- So cutting-edge that they don't trust an HTML coder 
- No spec sheet
- Communicating is difficult


---


# 

## Too cutting-edge

- Ruby on Rails
- Backbone.js
- Chapline.js
- Handlebars
- Sass (SASS Style)

※2013

# Too cutting-edge

## Standard of technology options - when working with a client 

- Difficult to use things that change while you're using them 
- Important to use something that can be used continually 
- Important to have lots of engineers that can use the tool
- Best to use something relatively old and stable 


---


# Too cutting-edge 

## Standard of technology options- when working with a product company 技術選択の基準 - サービス企業の場合

- Having short-term goals to achieve 
- Using the team's existing skills 
- Motivation of the team is very important 


---


# Too cutting-edge 

## Strategies

-  Always trying to use wide range of technology (broad but shallow)
-  （受託企業は）常に薄く広く新しい技術をカバーしておく
- The company does not try to be responsible for everything 全てを受託企業の責任でやろうとしない
- Important to try to do 80 percent and leave 20 percent up to an expert in the team 重要なこと8割に集中し2割はチームのエキスパートに頼る

---


# Problems that came up when participating 参加時の問題

## No spec sheet 

- Only working in applications with PSDs 
- If you have a problem you talk about it in GitHub 
- People who come in later or after the process don’t know who to ask about things

---


# 仕様書がない
No spec sheet 

## 仕様書の扱い - 受託の場合

Using a spec sheet when working for a client 

- You have to clearly define what your responsibilities are 
- You have to clearly assign responsibility/fault when there is a problem 問題があったときに責任を明確にする
- The spec sheet is the centre of everything 仕様書が全ての中心


---


# 仕様書がない No spec sheet

## Using a spec sheet when working with a product company 仕様書の扱い - サービス企業の場合

- Things you decided yesterday will have already changed today 昨日決めた事は今日変わる
- If you have time to update the spec sheet you want to improve the service 仕様書をアップデートする時間があったらサービスを改善したい
- The service you’re working on is the centre of everything 今あるサービスが全ての中心


---


# 仕様書がない No spec sheet

## 対策 strategies

-  Decide on a “product guy” ”プロダクトガイ" を任命した
- Decide on the most knowledgeable person on the team even if you don’t have a spec sheet 仕様書はないけど仕様に一番詳しい人を決める
- Make a decision log 決めた事をログに残し続ける


---


# 参加時の問題 Problems while taking part 

## コミュニケーションが難しい Communication is difficult 

- Unclear agile system ふわっとしたアジャイル
- Situation changes daily 日々状況が変わる
- Lack of clarity other whether there should be a morning or evening meeting 朝会・夕会どうしよう


---


# コミュニケーションが難しい Communication is difficult 

## ワークフローの考え方 - 受託の場合 Work flow when working with a client 

- ウォーターフォールが多い Waterfall is common 
- Finishing what you’ve decided within the set time limit is important 決められた事を決められた期間に終わらせる事が大事 
- Not really allowed to go back and redo things 手戻りはあまり許されない


---


# コミュニケーションが難しい Communication is difficult 

## ワークフローの考え方 - サービス企業の場合 Work flow when working with a product company 

- スピードが大事 Speed is important 
- 今作っている物が正しいかなんて誰も知らない No one knows if what you’re making is correct 
-  組織にあったワークフローを採用し組織ごとに千差万別 For every organisation there’s a different work flow


---


# コミュニケーションが難しい Communication is difficult 

## 対策 Strategies 

- 大きな共有には必ず参加（Weekly Mtg.）、小さな共有は後から把握 Important to have a compulsory weekly meeting and then smaller meetings afterwards to share and understand things better 
- 緊急時の連絡体制を作る Make a system for communicating for emergency situations
- ワークフローに完全にのる必要はない It’s not necessary to follow the work flow to the letter 
- 必要な時に必要な物が出せていればいい As long as the essential things come out when needed it’s ok


---


# コミュニケーションが難しい Communication is difficult 

## Tips: KPT を出来るだけやる Do Keep/Problem/Try (KPT) as much as possible (keep what’s good, identify problems, try solutions)

- 毎週1回 チーム全体で KPT Do a KPT meeting with the team every week
- 状況が悪くなる前に声がかけられる Able to talk about things before the situation gets bad
- それぞれが感じている不安不満を共有することで見えないリスクを減らす Able to reduce unseen risk by sharing uncertainties and fears
- KPTはチームの健康診断 KPT is a weekly health checkup for the team

# これはひとつの例でしかない Only one example of this

それでも、

- 信頼関係を構築し  Build relationships of trust 
- プロセスをゆるく結合させることで  Loosely link the process together
- 受託企業はサービス企業に貢献できるし  ??? Clients can contribute to product companies 
- サービス企業は受託企業を有効に活用できる ???  Product companies can make good use of clients
